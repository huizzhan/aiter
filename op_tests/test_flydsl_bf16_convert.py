"""Unit tests for the gfx942 f32 -> bf16 converter (``_to_bf16``).

The converter is tested directly through a one-line probe kernel rather than
end-to-end, because the interesting inputs cannot be reached through the GDN
kernels' public surface: every bf16 input widens to f32 with its NaN payload in
the high bits, and every f32 input passes through arithmetic that quietens NaN
(setting bit 22) before the conversion. A low-payload NaN therefore only exists
at the converter's own boundary -- which is exactly where the rounding bias
turns it into infinity, so that is where it has to be tested.

  * ``fast=False`` (the shipped default) -- ``arith.truncf``, IEEE
    round-to-nearest-EVEN. NaN stays NaN and Inf stays Inf: the behaviour
    PR #4884 review item 4 asked for.
  * ``fast=True`` (``FAST_FP32_TO_FP16=1``) -- ``(bits + 0x8000) >> 16``,
    round-half-AWAY. Faster and **does not preserve NaN**. Its expectations are
    asserted against the documented formula, including the cases where it
    destroys a NaN, so the cost of the opt-in is written down rather than merely
    warned about.
