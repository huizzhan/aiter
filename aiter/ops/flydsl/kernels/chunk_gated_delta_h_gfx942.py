"""GDN K5 inter-chunk state scan (+ optional fused K6 output) — gfx942 FlyDSL.

For each chunk t (serial over NT chunks):
  1. Store h snapshot for downstream K6
  2. v_new = u - w @ h   (delta correction via MFMA)
  3. Gated decay + state update:
       v_new *= exp(g_last - g_cumsum)
       h = h * exp(g_last) + k^T @ v_new

``COMPUTE_OUTPUT=True`` additionally fuses the K6 inter/intra-chunk output into
the same dispatch, so ``h`` and the gated ``v_new`` stay resident in LDS instead
of round-tripping through HBM. The fused body appends, per chunk:
  4. o  = q @ h^T                              (GEMM3, inter-chunk)
     A  = tril(q @ k^T)                        (GEMM4a + causal mask)
     o  = scale * (exp(g_i) * o + exp(g_i - g_last) * (A @ v_new_gated))
     store o -> HBM [T_flat, H, V]
The fused path pairs with ``STORE_H=False`` / ``SAVE_NEW_VALUE=False``, which
elide the two HBM drains that only the separate K6 kernel consumes.

    ``Vector``. Returns a raw ``ir.Value``.

    Do not replace this with ``.truncf()`` / ``.to(BFloat16)``. Those emit
    ``arith.truncf``, which MLIR defines as round-to-nearest-even; gfx942 lacks
    ``v_cvt_pk_bf16_f32``, and this implementationis tuned for gfx942.

    Plain truncation (``bits >> 16``) is ~2 VALU but too lossy here.
    The 0x8000 bias costs one add and restores <=0.5 ulp symmetric error.

    Ties round away from zero, not to even. Values are sign-magnitude so one
    bias serves both signs, and the carry can only perturb the exponent within
    ~1 ulp of FLT_MAX.

    NaN needs a guard. The 0x8000 bias carries into the exponent field for any
    NaN whose payload lives entirely below bit 16 -- 0x7F800001 rounds to
    0x7F80, which is +Inf, turning "not a number" into "infinitely large". Such
    low-payload NaNs are what an integer-coded or hardware-generated NaN
    typically looks like. Infinity itself survives the bias untouched
    (0x7F800000 + 0x8000 >> 16 == 0x7F80), so only NaN needs handling.

    For NaN we take the raw high half and force the quiet bit instead of
    rounding: that keeps the sign and the payload bits bf16 can represent, and
    quietens a signaling NaN. Quietening is what IEEE-754 conversion and the
    hardware ``v_cvt`` do -- bf16 has no way to carry a payload small enough to
    distinguish sNaN from qNaN, so preserving NaN-ness is the strongest
    guarantee available.
